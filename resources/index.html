                                    Sometimes getting someone to pick up an old non-running clunker is such a pain.  Before I contacted Calgary Auto Scrap Removal I went through a bunch of other auto recyclers who refused to come take the car due to its location.  I know I'm not the only one who lives someplace with underground parking.  I recommend Calgary Auto Scrap Removal for anyone living in downtown Calgary.

Selling it was something we were very cautious about. Calgary Scrap Auto Removal assured us that the entire vehicle would be reused or recycled in some form, and that we deserved to gain something for our efforts to recycle it.  Because we asked about the recycling process, the company kept us abreast of the entire procedure from start to finish.  Our Deepest gratitude for allowing us to rest easy knowing we have done the right thing</p>
